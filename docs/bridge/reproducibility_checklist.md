# Reproducibility Checklist for ML Experiments

**Purpose:** Ensure experiments can be reproduced reliably across runs and environments.

## Random Seeds

*(Code snippets to be added during Day 65 Bridge Sprint)*

```python
# Placeholder - add complete seed-setting code
import torch
import numpy as np
import random

torch.manual_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
random.seed(42)
```

## Deterministic Algorithms

*(Configuration details to be added during Day 65 Bridge Sprint)*

## Hardware Consistency

*(Version pinning strategies to be added during Day 65 Bridge Sprint)*

## Environment Specification

*(requirements.txt management to be added during Day 65 Bridge Sprint)*

## Logging

*(Hyperparameter and metric logging templates to be added during Day 65 Bridge Sprint)*
