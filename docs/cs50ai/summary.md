## Module Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive summary of the CS50AI Integration Module, which replaces the traditional Classical ML phase with Harvard's CS50 Introduction to AI course supplemented by custom depth extensions. The module provides broader AI survey coverage including search algorithms, logical reasoning, optimization, supervised ML, and neural networks fundamentals.

**Design Rationale:** The CS50AI integration eliminates redundancy with Phase 4 (Deep Learning Core) while providing essential AI fundamentals and a stronger bridge to Transformer-based LLM systems in Phase 6+.
