# Classical ML Phase 3 - Original Content (Archived)

**Archived Date:** 2025-11-10

This document archives the original Classical ML Phase 3 content that was replaced by the CS50AI Survey + Bridge Sprint restructuring.

## Original Structure

Phase 3 originally consisted of 21 days (Days 50-70) focused on classical machine learning with scikit-learn, covering:

- Supervised learning algorithms (linear models, trees, ensembles)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Model evaluation and selection
- Feature engineering
- Classical ML pipelines

## Reason for Archival

The original Classical ML content was found to be:
1. **Time-intensive**: 21 days was too long given that deep learning content would cover many ML fundamentals
2. **Redundant**: Significant overlap with Deep Learning Phase 4 content
3. **Less aligned**: Not optimally focused on the LLM/Transformer learning path

## Replacement Structure

**New Phase 3B: CS50AI Survey & Bridge Sprint (18 days, Days 50-67)**

### CS50AI Survey (14 days: Days 50-63)
Each CS50AI module split into 2-day units:
- Days 50-51: Search (Lecture + Problem Set)
- Days 52-53: Knowledge (Lecture + Problem Set)
- Days 54-55: Uncertainty (Lecture + Problem Set)
- Days 56-57: Optimization & CSP (Lecture + Problem Set)
- Days 58-59: Learning (Lecture + Problem Set)
- Days 60-61: Neural Networks (Lecture + Problem Set)
- Days 62-63: Language (Lecture + Problem Set)

### Bridge Sprint (4 days: Days 64-67)
Detailed preparation for Deep Learning:
- Day 64: ML → Transformer conceptual rationale
- Day 65: Reproducibility & environment setup
- Day 66: Data pipeline skeleton (Dataset/DataLoader)
- Day 67: Attention math & masking sanity checks

### Early Start (Day 68+)
After Bridge Sprint completion, learners can optionally begin Deep Learning Core (Phase 4) at Day 68 instead of waiting until Day 71.

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Time efficiency**: Reduced from 21 to 18 days while covering more relevant content
2. **Better preparation**: CS50AI provides broader AI survey, Bridge Sprint ensures Transformer-ready
3. **Acceleration**: Early start option enables faster progression to transformers
4. **Reduced redundancy**: Eliminates overlap with Phase 4 content

## Original Day Topics (Reference)

Days 50-70 originally covered (content details not preserved):
- Linear regression, logistic regression
- Decision trees and random forests
- Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering
- PCA, t-SNE
- Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model interpretation

This content is superseded by the new structure but can be revisited independently if needed.
